## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlexKalll/top-academy.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd top-academy
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies (if any):**
    This project is primarily front-end, so no specific `npm` or `yarn` dependencies are required for the core website. However, if you plan to run the chatbot locally with Groq, ensure you have Node.js installed and set up your `.env` file.

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API key:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
    ```

## Usage

Open the `home.html` file in your web browser to view the website. You can navigate through the different pages (Home, Services, About, Contact, FAQs) using the navigation bar.
